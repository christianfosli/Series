# Series

## Background

In my math course at uni we often have exercises to figure out whether a series
converges or diverges. Sometimes we also need to evaluate the series.

As a quick way to check how the series behaves, and check my answers, I made this
python script. 

## Description

The script evaluates and prints a given series for each n terms in a given range,
until the terms (an) appear to go to zero.

## How to use

For now one must simply change 'an' and 'range' in the python script itself to
evaluate different functions. 

Accuracy may also be adjusted by changing the values of 'epsilon' and 'zeroCountTo'
