# Series

## Description

In my math course we often have exercises to figure out whether or not a series
converges or diverges. Sometimes we also need to evaluate the series.

As a quick way to check how the series behaves, and check my answers, I made this
python script to print a series within a mentioned range, until an appears to go
to zero.

## How to use this

For now one must simply change 'an' and 'range' in the python script itself to
evaluate different functions. 'Epsilon' may also be adjusted as needed.

In the future, I may try to change this to take 'an' as a parameter.
